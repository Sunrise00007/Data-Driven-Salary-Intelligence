# Data-Driven-Salary-Intelligence
An Exploratory Analysis of the Global Data Science Job Market
Overview

Compensation benchmarking in the data industry is often driven by assumptions rather than evidence. Job titles alone rarely capture the true determinants of salary, and both employers and professionals struggle to make informed decisions in a rapidly evolving market.

This project aims to bridge that gap by performing a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of global data science salary data. The objective is to identify key salary drivers, uncover compensation patterns, and translate raw data into actionable insights that can support hiring strategies and career planning.

Problem Statement

Organizations face challenges in:

Establishing competitive and fair salary structures

Understanding how experience, role, and company size influence compensation

Optimizing hiring decisions across geographies

Professionals, on the other hand, often lack clarity on:

Realistic salary expectations by role and experience

Career progression and compensation growth patterns

Trade-offs between company size, role, and location

This project uses historical hiring data to analyze how these factors interact and what truly drives compensation in the data science job market.
